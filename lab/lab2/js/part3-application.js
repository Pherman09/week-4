  Lab 2, part3: a full application

  We're going to use the skills we've just been practicing to write a full application
  which is responsive to user input.
  At your disposal are a set of global variables which track user input (see
  part3-main.js and part3-setup.js for more details on how this is done — we'll
  cover this topic at a later date). Their values will be logged to console to
  aid in debugging.

  In this lab, which is very much open-ended, your task is to use the value of
  these variables to define the functions below. Try to come up with interesting
  uses of the provided user input.

  Some ideas:
    There are two numeric fields: can you write this application so as to filter
    using both minimum and maximum?
    There is a boolean field: can you write your code to filter according to this
    boolean? (Try to think about how you could chop your data to make this meaningful.)
    There is a string field: can you write your code to filter/search based on user
    input?

  Remember, this is open-ended. Try to see what you can produce.

/* =====================
  Define a resetMap function to remove markers from the map and clear the array of markers
===================== */
var resetMap = function() {
  _.each(myMarkers,function(mark){
    map.removeLayer(mark);
  });
  myMarkers = [];
};

/* =====================
  Define a getAndParseData function to grab our dataset through a jQuery.ajax call ($.ajax). It
  will be called as soon as the application starts. Be sure to parse your data once you've pulled
  it down!
===================== */
var getAndParseData = function() {
  $.ajax("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CPLN690-MUSA610/datasets/master/json/philadelphia-bike-crashes-snippet.json").done(function(result){
    var jsOB = JSON.parse(result);
    myData = jsOB;
    });
};

/* =====================
  Call our plotData function. It should plot all the markers that meet our criteria (whatever that
  criteria happens to be — that's entirely up to you)
===================== */
var plotData = function() {
  myData = _.filter(myData, function(ob){
    return ob.ILLUMINATI > numericField1;
  });
  _.each (myData, function(ob){
    var lat = ob.LAT;
    var lng = ob.LNG;
    myMarkers.push(L.marker([lat, lng]));
  });
  _.each(myMarkers, function(mark){
    mark.addTo(map);
  });
};
